This is an archive of my  projects from the [Computation Design Practices](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/programs/15-m-s-computational-design-practices) degree program at [Columbia GSAPP](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/). It also includes some case studies and work done at the [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/).

I am an urbanist-technologist driven to change how we live, work, move, and play in our cities. In my years of experience, I have come to have a proven and competitive track record in translating company mission needs into meaningful and tangible results. My key talent is adapting, learning, and leading teams effectively and quickly. In addition, I enjoy being put into fast-paced, challenging environments that require interdisciplinary knowledge of business needs, design thinking, and technical expertise in developing products or solutions. 

My skills include exploring multiple avenues for a product roadmap, assessing their risks and advantages, and applying thought leadership throughout the product lifecycle. In addition, I have proven skillsets in geospatial intelligence, user research, design, mobility solutions, urban design, and product development.

Things I think about and work on: Transit Tech, Sensing, Climate Tech, and Generative Design üåç

I love being outdoors and spending weekends in parks or kayaking and am always happy to chat; reach me via v.george@columbia.edu üìß
