BlindEye is a collective area network that uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning to detect and classify objects in a given area. The system is composed of a number of cameras that are connected to a central server. The server then processes the images from the cameras and sends the results to a web application. The web application then displays the results in a user-friendly manner.
